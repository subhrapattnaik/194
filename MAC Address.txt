That is where the mac address comes into the picture. It is
also called a physical address. Because it is assigned by
the manufactures of the device.and it cannot be changed.
All the devices which can connect to a network need a
mac address.
Mac stands for Media Access Control.

To see the mac address of our computer we can simple
type a command in the command prompt as ipconfig /all
(Ifconfig /all for mac os).

Here you will see a lot of information. The mac address is
called a physical address.

But you can that we have multiple mac addresses here.
This is because each networking device in the computer
has a mac address.

The computer has an ethernet device, which helps us to
connect with networking using a LAN cable.

Then we have a wifi module and bluetooth module as well.
So all of these devices are assigned a mac address.

This is the mac address of the wifi module of my computer.
The Mac address is a 12 digit hexadecimal number

The first 6 digits of the mac address tells us about the
manufacturers. So these will be the same for all the
devices made by that manufacturer.
Rest of the 6 digits are unique for each device.
2 devices can not have the same mac address.
