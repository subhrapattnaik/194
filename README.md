Every device on your network has something called a MAC address. MAC stands for Media Access Control. It helps to identify and differentiate between various devices. It is a set of 12 digits that is unique for each device in the world.
\
\
It is a set of 12 digits, in which the first 6 digits refer to the manufacturer of the device, or the brand/company which has produced your mobile or PC, etc. The rest of the 6 digits are the ones which are unique for each device. No two devices can have the same combination of these 6 digits. The MAC Address is issued to you by the manufacturer and it cannot be changed. 

--------------------------------------------------

The IP address is a unique set of numbers assigned to a computer on a network.

that on a network of computers, two computers can not have the same IP address. It is unique for each computer and is used to identify a computer on a network. But isn't this somewhat similar to what we just discussed about MAC addresses? 
------------------------------------------------------
\
both of them are unique numbers used to identify devices.

\Both IP and MAC Addresses are a set of unique digits to identify a computer/device. The major difference between them is that a MAC Address is permanent whereas an IP Address can change. MAC address identifies the physical address of a computer while IP address identifies the connection of a computer on the internet. 

----------------------------------------
it's time to find out the MAC address of our device! Let's see how to do it. 
But before that, we are going to learn a few networking commands. Networking commands are a great tool to diagnose network issues and find details.

----------------------------------------
\
explore a few networking commands in the command prompt(in windows) or in the terminal (in MacOS).

\
switch was a device which can work like an extension device, to provide us with a number of ports where we can connect other computers. With the help of this device, we can connect more than 2 computers with each other. This extension device that we discussed is called a Switch. 
\
Switch is a networking device which helps us to connect multiple devices together and forms a LAN (Local Area Network).
Switches are very helpful when we create networks for homes, schools etc.
-----------------------
\A switch is a networking device which receives a message from any device in the network and transmits it only to the device for which it was meant. This makes the switch more intelligent than other devices which receive a message and transmit it to all the other devices on the network. 
The switch does this by storing the MAC addresses of the devices which are connected to the network. Then, when a message is to be delivered to a specific device on the network, it compares the MAC address written on the message with the MAC addresses of the devices. Then it sends the message to the specific device whose MAC address was mentioned on the message.

practical work:

let's add 3 computer to our network and connect them using a switch.
